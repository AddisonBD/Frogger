added the ace attorney font because it looks nice.
added obj_safegrass so that the game can be won.
added a few homemade sounds - thinking of 3 lives then gameover, maybe.
	dont have to use the gameover sound, though. the ow is more funny
added start room. this will be obstacle/player-less.
added start room's text/controller object.
added global variables. start room is now also the end room.
	made obj_text_etc Persistent. this lets it keep the global variables.
	globals went into player create so that the text clears.
	
	if wanted we could get rid of the start screen. obj_text_etc could create
		and/or destroy the other instances.
		
changed spr_obstacle's origin to top center so that it lines up in the grid.
added obj_lilypad. variable onPlatform is important so that it doesn't count being in water first.
copied code for obstacles to create logs.

got obstacles/logs to move opposite directions depending on where their controller is.

moved a few collision checks to step.
	this lets the variables change like they're supposed to.


sprites to add:
-fix yeehaw to be right size
-make yeehaw frown when run over
-add splash
-make grass pwetty
-make obstacles Obstacle Shaped. idk what it will be yet
