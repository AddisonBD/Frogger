added the ace attorney font because it looks nice.
added obj_safegrass so that the game can be won.
added a few homemade sounds - thinking of 3 lives then gameover, maybe.
	dont have to use the gameover sound, though. the ow is more funny
added start room. this will be obstacle/player-less.
added start room's text/controller object.
